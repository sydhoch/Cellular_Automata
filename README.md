### Timeline

Start Date: February 20, 2019

Finish Date: March 8, 2019

Hours Spent: 150 (add in your hours)

### Primary Roles
Sara: I did all of the front end work, taking the lead on all of the classes in the frontend package. I also wrote the Grid class and some of the Neighborhood class.

Sydney: I made all of the Cell classes, set up the neighbors in the neighborhood class, wrote tests for cell class and neighborhood classes, made grids able to implement the grid outline feature, worked on the grid class, made the simulation driver class, and did some refactoring of the play class.

### Running the Program

Main class: SimulationDriver

Data files needed: 

Interesting data files:

Features implemented:
- To step through, click on "start/end step through" and use the spacebar to step.
- To change an individual cell state, pause the simulation and double click a cell. It will switch to the next state.

Assumptions or Simplifications:
- Images can only be implemented as rectangular. They cannot represent triangle or hexagon cells.

Known Bugs:
- The hexagon display doesn't always fill the screen properly.

### Impressions
This project was a really good challenge for implementing good design.
